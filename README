				  Compile and Run
=====================================================================================
to compile run 'make'

to execute run './master'
-h: for help
-r: for integer to test processes on
-x: to run logn processess

Ctrl + c will kill all child processess if pressed during the runtime. Master will
cycle through the pid array of active children and terminate thier process.

An alarm is set for 100 seconds and will do the same thing as ctrl+c if the time 
limit is reached. This should only happen for n/2 processess if 64 is input.

					Issues
======================================================================================
was running into issues trying to use a forloop in the child process

let the child processess naturally increment from index in master. Once i did this
i was able to fix my incrementing problem.

for some reason i am still getting the printout in master at the bottom rather than
the top but thats small potatoes.
